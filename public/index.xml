      <description>What We BelieveThat the Bible, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is the inerrant and complete Word of God, the final authority on all matters of faith and practice. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Jude 3).That there is one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; Luke 3:21-22).That the Lord Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, and is true God and True man.</description>
