                        <p class="m_bottom_15" style="color: white;">Biblical Truth — God has revealed himself in the Bible. The Bible is God-inspired truth that tells the story of God’s redemptive work in history, and it is foundational to our spiritual lives. Everything we believe and do at RMBC is therefore rooted in biblical teaching. (Ps. 19:7-14; John 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:21-22) </p>

God is the only proper object of worship, and he alone is supremely satisfying and worthy. God does all things for his glory, so we strive to do the same with hearts that love, honor, and rejoice in God. (Ps. 63:1-5; Matt. 22:27-28; 1 Cor. 10:31; Eph. 1:3-14; Rev. 4:11; 5:11-14) </p>

All of our values are founded on the gospel and infused with a passion for it. This same gospel saves us initially, transforms us daily, and secures us eternally. (Luke 24:25-27; Rom. 1:16-17; 8:28-39; 12:1-2; Gal. 2:20; 6:14; Eph. 4:1-7; Col. 2:6-7) </p>

                        <p class="m_bottom_15" style="color: white;">Prayer — God’s work can advance only by God’s power. We can do nothing without Christ, so we devote ourselves to prayer, humbly seeking God’s power through God’s Spirit to carry out God’s work. Prayer is an essential part of our relationship with God. In prayer we cast our cares on God, express our trust in him, thank him for his gifts, and worship him. (Ps. 127; Zech. 4; Matt. 6:5-13; John 15:5; Acts 1:8, 14; 2:42; 4:23-31; 13:1-3; Rom. 8:26-27; Heb. 4:16; 1 Pet. 5:5-7) </p>

                        <p class="m_bottom_15" style="color: white;">Christian Community — God has shown us love and grace in Christ, so we are committed to showing one another love and grace at RMBC. God has adopted us into his family and united us to one another as members of Christ’s body. Such community is a vital part of how we grow to be more like Jesus. (Rom. 8:14-17; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 2:1-10; 4:1-32; Heb. 10:19-31) </p>

                        <p class="m_bottom_15" style="color: white;">Spiritual Growth — God’s goal for all Christians is to conform them to Christ’s image. By the energy God provides, we labor to see Christ formed in every believer at RMBC, and we emphasize the Bible, prayer, and Christian fellowship as essential means of God’s transforming grace.

As ambassadors for Christ, we clearly, lovingly, and boldly call people to be reconciled to God through personal repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as the only Lord and Savior (Matt. 28:18-20; Acts 13:1-14:28; Rom. 15:18-33; 2 Cor. 5:14-21; Rev. 5:9-10; 7:9-10) </p>

                <h3 class="fw_light color_dark m_bottom_15 tr_all">A Spiritual House</h3>
                <p>You yourselves, as living stones, a spiritual house, are being built to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5).</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Imagine a church that’s more than a building.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">It’s a spiritual house built with living stones—people who have found new life in Jesus Christ. Such a church is built on Christ as its foundation, and it makes him preeminent as its cornerstone by exalting and depending on him in its singing, praying, preaching, and giving. This church radiates the beauty of Christ as its members prayerfully pursue the joy and power of the Holy Spirit who lives in them.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This spiritual house exists for the worship of God. Each living stone experiences ever-increasing delight in an ever-deepening relationship with God, and they love him with their whole being. They proclaim the truth of God in the power of the Spirit as they eagerly gather for joyful, reverent worship. These are Bible-saturated people who think, speak, and live Bible because they hunger for Christ and his Word, seeking to grow into Christ’s image by gazing upon his transformative glory. They trade distractions like entertainment and “the American dream” for an eternally satisfying relationship with Christ.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This spiritual house is holy, set apart as God’s home. Such a church embraces humble, gospel-powered holiness, not to gain favor with God, but because God has already shown them favor in Christ. They kill sin and grow in righteousness by the Spirit’s power, not their own. They recognize that anything good in them comes from Christ, and they refuse to view the lost as “unclean” or beneath them. In all things, they are shaped by the cross, not the culture.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">By God’s grace, this is what Rocky Mountain Bible Church strives to be.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">(Ps. 63:1-5; 119:11, 97; Matt. 22:27-28; Luke 10:38-41; John 4:24; 5:39; Acts 2:42; 4:23-31; Rom. 6:1-14; 7:18; 8:12-13; 12:1-2; 1 Cor. 3:9-17; 6:18-20; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; 8:1-9:15; Gal. 5:16-26; Eph. 1:3-14; 2:1-10, 19-22; Col. 3:16-17; 1 Pet. 2:4-10; 1 John 2:15-17)</p>

                <h3 class="fw_light color_dark m_bottom_15 tr_all">A Growing Body</h3>
                <p>Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another (Romans 12:4-5).</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Imagine a church growing in unity, love, service, and Christlikeness.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This church is a body in which the members are tightly bound together by Christ and his gospel, not personal preferences, opinions, hobbies, or traditions. They choose to display the gospel’s uniting power when disagreements, differences, and debatable issues arise, instead of quarreling and separating. They embrace God-given diversity—no matter someone’s ethnicity, age, appearance, economic status, social class, or past sins. As one body, they move forward with one mission for the glory of the one true God.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this body, the members bear one another’s spiritual and physical burdens with genuine care, weeping with those who weep and rejoicing with those who rejoice. They regularly meet outside of Sunday services to serve, encourage, disciple, and spend time with one another.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this body, each member is equipped with Spirit-given gifts and serving at full capacity to build up the church. Leaders are strategically developed at every level so they can have spiritual impact within their spheres of influence. As the members gather for worship, they come with an attitude of “What can I give?” rather than “What can I get?” </p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this body, each member lovingly speaks and lives the truth so that the body reaches Christlike maturity. This church is Christ’s hands and feet, displaying Jesus’ love and beauty to a dark and dying world. They humbly give and receive correction, growing in the gospel in every area of life. They build transparent, meaningful, cross-generational relationships for spiritual growth, rather than big budgets, buildings, and programs.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">By God’s grace, this is what Rocky Mountain Bible Church strives to be.</p>

                <p>I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you must also love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another (John 13:34-35).</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Imagine a church full of loving servants.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">These servants are characterized Jesus’ humility. They set aside their rights, status, opinions, and preferences to serve others, build up the church, and glorify God. They think of others as more important than themselves and pursue others’ interests above their own.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">These servants possess the forward-moving, outward-looking love of Christ, who washed even Judas’ feet and laid down his life for his sheep. Such people proactively seek the good of others at any cost and without any distinction. Constrained by the love of Christ, they love their neighbors as themselves and allow God to shape their definition of “neighbor.”</p>

                <p>On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overpower it (Matthew 16:18).</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Imagine a church pursuing a mission with single-minded passion.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This church is an army that storms the gates of hell to rescue the lost, facing mountain-sized obstacles with mountain-moving faith in the promises of God. They live with wartime simplicity because they have a sober-minded focus on their God-given mission. They embrace the sacrifices and risks necessary to take the gospel across the street and around the world, and they value God’s kingdom over their comforts.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This army is Spirit-empowered, advancing on its knees as it engages in spiritual warfare against the powers of darkness. With the strength and armor of God, they persevere through the darkness and difficulty of battle, boldly trusting that Christ has won the victory, and eagerly awaiting the day he returns to make his enemies his footstool.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this army, each soldier sees the lost with Christ’s love and compassion. They take initiative to be close friends of sinners, not distant, fearful judges. They seek to make disciples, not win arguments or get decisions. These rescue soldiers walk side-by-side with people as they come to know Christ, recover from spiritual deadness, and grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This army trains and deploys other “military units” for Christ’s mission. They send and support local and international church planters as God allows, and they partner with other biblically faithful churches to spread the gospel. This church’s vision for its ministry breaks beyond what they see in their own time and place, and it stretches throughout the world and eternity. They long for God to use them to raise up the next generation of gospel soldiers who will carry on Christ’s mission after they’re gone.</p>
