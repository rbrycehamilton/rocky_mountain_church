mission_title="What We Do"
mission_subtitle="Our Mission"
mission_body="Rocky Mountain Bible Church exists to make, grow, and send disciples of Jesus Christ for the advancement and enjoyment of God’s glory. (Matt. 28:16-20)"

core_values_title="What We Value"
core_values_subtitle="Our Core Values"
core_values_1="Biblical Truth"
biblical_truth="Biblical Truth — God has revealed himself in the Bible. The Bible is God-inspired truth that tells the story of God’s redemptive work in history, and it is foundational to our spiritual lives. Everything we believe and do at RMBC is therefore rooted in biblical teaching. (Ps. 19:7-14; John 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:21-22)"
core_values_2="The Glory of God"
glory="The Glory of God — God’s glory is the greatest good of God’s people. God is the only proper object of worship, and he alone is supremely satisfying and worthy. God does all things for his glory, so we strive to do the same with hearts that love, honor, and rejoice in God. (Ps. 63:1-5; Matt. 22:27-28; 1 Cor. 10:31; Eph. 1:3-14; Rev. 4:11; 5:11-14)"
core_values_3="The Gospel of Christ"
gospel="The Gospel of Christ — God’s saving grace and power are found in the gospel, and this good news of Jesus Christ is the central message of the Bible. All of our values are founded on the gospel and infused with a passion for it. This same gospel saves us initially, transforms us daily, and secures us eternally. (Luke 24:25-27; Rom. 1:16-17; 8:28-39; 12:1-2; Gal. 2:20; 6:14; Eph. 4:1-7; Col. 2:6-7)"
core_values_4="Prayer"
prayer="Prayer — God’s work can advance only by God’s power. We can do nothing without Christ, so we devote ourselves to prayer, humbly seeking God’s power through God’s Spirit to carry out God’s work. Prayer is an essential part of our relationship with God. In prayer we worship God, confess our sins, thank God for his gifts, cast our cares on him, intercede for others, and express our trust in God. (Ps. 127; Zech. 4; Matt. 6:5-13; John 15:5; Acts 1:8, 14; 2:42; 4:23-31; 13:1-3; Rom. 8:26-27; Heb. 4:16; 1 Pet. 5:5-7)"
core_values_5="Christian Community"
community="Christian Community — God has shown us love and grace in Christ, so we are committed to showing one another love and grace at RMBC. God has adopted us into his family and united us to one another as members of Christ’s body. Such community is a vital part of how we grow to be more like Jesus. (Rom. 8:14-17; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 2:1-10; 4:1-32; Heb. 10:19-31)"
core_values_6="Spiritual Growth"
growth="Spiritual Growth — God’s goal for all Christians is to conform them to Christ’s image. By the energy God provides, we labor to see Christ formed in every believer at RMBC, and out of Christ’s rich provision, we make every effort to grow in our faith and confirm our calling and election. We emphasize the Bible, prayer, and Christian fellowship as essential means of God’s transforming grace. (Acts 20:32; Rom. 8:28-29; Eph. 4:7-16; Col. 1:28-29; Heb. 4:16; 2 Pet. 1:3-11)"
core_values_7="Missions"
missions="Missions — God is on a mission to glorify himself by redeeming people from every people group. We join in his mission by making disciples of Christ in our own community and sending out others to make disciples around the world. As ambassadors for Christ, we clearly, lovingly, and boldly call people to be reconciled to God through personal repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as the only Lord and Savior (Matt. 28:18-20; Acts 13:1-14:28; Rom. 15:18-33; 2 Cor. 5:14-21; Rev. 5:9-10; 7:9-10)"
