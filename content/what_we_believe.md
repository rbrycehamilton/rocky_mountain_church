doctrine10="That sanctification, which is separation unto God, is threefold; positionally, the believer was sanctified at conversion by virtue of union with Christ; progressively, through the Word as he walks in the Spirit; ultimately, he will be completely conformed to the image of Christ when he sees his Savior face to face.
